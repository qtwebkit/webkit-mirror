            Rubber stamped by Geoffrey Garen.

            This patch moves all the JavaScript tests from Source/JavaScriptCore/tests to
            a new top level directory, JSTests. Having the tests in the Source directory
            was both confusing an inconvenient for people that just want to checkout the
            source code of WebKit. Since there is no other obvious place to put all the
            JavaScript tests a new top level directory seemed the most sensible.

            * tests/: Deleted.
