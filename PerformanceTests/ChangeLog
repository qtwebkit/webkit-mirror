        Improve the performance of FontCascadeDescription's effectiveFamilies
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=184720

        Reviewed by Simon Fraser.

        This performance test calls SystemFontDatabase::systemFontCascadeList() around 2,000,000 times (before
        this patch is applied), which is roughly equivalent to the page we found the performance problem on.
        The calling pattern is roughly equivalent in this test.

        * Layout/system-ui.html: Added.

        * MallocBench/MallocBench.xcodeproj/project.pbxproj: Use c++14 so we
        can make_unique.

        Specify that we support all Darwin platforms so you can test them.

        * MallocBench/run-malloc-benchmarks: Specify the path to MallocBench
        and libmbmalloc explicitly, rather than computing them implicitly
        using webkitdirs. Non-WebKit folks don't have the directory structure
        required by webkitdirs.

        Remove Linux-specific and cmake-specific behaviors because we only
        needed them in the world of implicit path computation.

        Make run-perf-tests work with StyleBench and re-enable it
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=182322

        Reviewed by Antti Koivisto.

        This patch updates the test harness to report new metrics of StyleBench.

        Replaced the total time by the geometric mean of the time spent in each suite, and added scores
        as a metric in addition to time. Also, updated the PerfTestRunner harness and the results template
        to support "Score" metric with "pt" as its unit.

        * Skipped: Unskipped the test.
        * StyleBench/resources/benchmark-report.js:
        (window.benchmarkClient.willStartFirstIteration..createTest): Added the unit as an optional argument

        (window.benchmarkClient.willStartFirstIteration): Report the geomean of time.
        (window.benchmarkClient.didRunSuites): Record the entire measuredValues instead of just tests.

        Reviewed by Ryosuke Niwa.

        The test should be doing multiple rounds of mutations in a single document to test what is supposed to test (like it did before r227756).
        This also makes test results more stable and less dependent on possible first-time costs.

        Generate 10 rounds of class/element mutation steps.
        Give each generated step unique name so reporting works.

        Copied resource files referenced from Speedometer directory since run-benchmark needs to be able
        to checkout each benchmark separately.

        Removed the code to create tests of the same name five times in makeSteps since this
        won't be compatible with either run-benchmark or run-perf-tests.
