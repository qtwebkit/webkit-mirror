    <!-- The left (respectively right) parenthesis only has a prefix
         (respectively postfix) form which gives its stretchiness.
         In theory, the parenthesis in the middle of the <math> element are
         considered infix operators and should not stretch. Let's check that we
         fallback to the postfix/prefix forms and actually make them stretchy.
         This is to handle bad MathML markup that misses explicit <mrow> tags.
