This test checks that when a user focuses on the "first input" text field, modifies its contents, and then defocuses it by pressing the tab key that the following DOM events are fired in order: Focus, Change, Blur, Focus (on "second input"). Note, this test must be run by Dump Render Tree.

On success, you will see a series of "PASS" messages, followed by "TEST COMPLETE".

FAIL fired event is (firstInput, blur). Should be (firstInput, change).
FAIL fired event is (secondInput, focus). Should be (firstInput, blur).
