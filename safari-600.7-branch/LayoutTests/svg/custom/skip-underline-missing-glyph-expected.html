This test makes sure that there is no ASSERT hit when we are attempting to draw
a skip:ink text decoration on SVG text where the SVG font does not have all the
glyphs that we need.

This test also tests that, in this situation, no gaps are drawn at all. This
test will need to be altered when we finally support mixed SVG and non-SVG
fonts along with skip:ink decorations.
