Test generating a HMAC key.

On success, you will see a series of "PASS" messages, followed by "TEST COMPLETE".


PASS crypto.subtle.generateKey("hmac", extractable, ["sign", "verify"]) threw exception TypeError: Type error.
PASS crypto.subtle.generateKey({name: "hmac"}, extractable, ["sign", "verify"]) threw exception Error: NotSupportedError: DOM Exception 9.
PASS crypto.subtle.generateKey({name: "hmac", length: undefined}, extractable, ["sign", "verify"]) threw exception Error: NotSupportedError: DOM Exception 9.
PASS crypto.subtle.generateKey({name: "hmac", length: {}}, extractable, ["sign", "verify"]) threw exception Error: NotSupportedError: DOM Exception 9.

Generating a key with default length...
