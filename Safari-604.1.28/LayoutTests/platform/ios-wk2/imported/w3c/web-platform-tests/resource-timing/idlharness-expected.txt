Resource Timing IDL tests


PASS Performance interface: operation clearResourceTimings() 
PASS Performance interface: operation setResourceTimingBufferSize(unsigned long) 
PASS Performance interface: attribute onresourcetimingbufferfull 
PASS Performance must be primary interface of window.performance 
PASS Stringification of window.performance 
PASS Performance interface: window.performance must inherit property "clearResourceTimings" with the proper type (3) 
PASS Performance interface: window.performance must inherit property "setResourceTimingBufferSize" with the proper type (4) 
PASS Performance interface: calling setResourceTimingBufferSize(unsigned long) on window.performance with too few arguments must throw TypeError 
PASS Performance interface: window.performance must inherit property "onresourcetimingbufferfull" with the proper type (5)
