Testing that an injected script, run while the debugger is paused and the timeline profiler is enabled, should not loop forever if it has an exception thrown.

Added a breakpoint inside hook().
Debugger paused;
An exception was thrown from the injected script.
Debugger resumed; stopping timeline capture.
Timeline capturing stopped. Inspecting the active recording....
TimerFired timeline record has profile attached: TRUE
