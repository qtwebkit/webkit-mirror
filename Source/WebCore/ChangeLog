            Reviewed by Simon Fraser.

            Make the dispatching of resourcetimingbufferfull event asynchronous to avoid dispatching it
            synchronously during a style resolution when CachedResourceLoader::requestImage requests
            a previously loaded image.

            We now schedule a timer when the resource timing buffer becomes full, and dispatch the event
            when the timer fires. Meanwhile, we have a backup buffer to which additional resource timing
            entries would be added. Once the event is dispatched, we refill the buffer exposed to author
            scripts. When refilling the buffer results in it becoming full again, we keep repeating the
            process of firing resourcetimingbufferfull and re-filling the buffer until either we stop
            making progress (i.e. the script didn't increase the number of empty entires in the buffer)
            or the backup buffer (at the time we started this process) becomes empty.

            Also fixed a bug that we were firing resourcetimingbufferfull event when the last entry that
            fits within the buffer size was added instead of when an entry is being added to an already
            full buffer. To make this work, the patch introduces m_resourceTimingBufferFullFlag,
            representing the concept "resource timing buffer full" flag in the resource timing specification.

        [Cairo] Use isolated fill and stroke source containers
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=181386

        Reviewed by Carlos Garcia Campos.

        Generate fill and stroke source objects upon invocation of various Cairo
        operations, initializing necessary data from the GraphicsContextState
        object.

        Cairo::FillSource and Cairo::StrokeSource structs are introduced, both
        being default-constructible as well as providing a constructor that
        accepts a GraphicsContextState object from which the appropriate
        resources are created.

        The FillSource and StrokeSource objects are then passed to
        PlatformContextCairo's prepareForFilling() and prepareForStroking()
        methods. Here the helper prepareCairoContextSource() function is now
        invoked with cairo_pattern_t objects as pattern or gradient sources, or
        the source color if neither cairo_pattern_t object is specified.

        The FillSource and StrokeSource constructors mimic the previous behavior
        of prepareCairoContextSource(). In case the source is a Pattern object,
        a cairo_pattern_t object is created from that. In case of FillSource,
        we also retrieve pattern size, transform and repetition information. In
        case the source os a Gradient object, we create a 'base' cairo_pattern_t
        object for a completely opaque alpha channel. Additionally, if the alpha
        value on the state is not 1, we create an alpha-adjusted cairo_pattern_t
        that is potentially used for any filling or stroking operation that has
        to preserve transparency. If neither Pattern or Gradient objects are set
        on the GraphicsContextState, we default to the current fill or stroke
        color.

        Overall, there's no change in behavior, this is simply a refactoring
        that enables us to construct Cairo objects for filling and stroking
        sources at the time of Cairo operation dispatch, instead of pulling down
        GraphicsContextState deeper into the Cairo-specific code.

        This object has currently one method to trigger change in the online/offline status.
        This allows writing a test for the onLine feature.

        Note that self.internals is inserted asynchronously after the script was evaluated.
        When writing a worker script using self.internals, one must make sure to use self.internals when initialized.
        online-worker.js for instance makes use of self.internals in a postMessage callback.

        [Cairo] Contain shadow blur requirement state in a separate object
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=181380

        Reviewed by Carlos Garcia Campos.

        Instead of picking up the necessary state parameters from a
        GraphicsContextState object, store the necessary parameters in a helper
        ShadowBlurUsage struct. Mimicking the mustUseShadowBlur() function that
        is being removed, values of the shadow color, shadow blur, and shadow
        transform ignorance are stored there. Additionally, the required()
        method accepts a PlatformContextCairo object through which it can
        retrieve the current CTM and determine whether it's an identity, finally
        deciding whether shadow blur can or cannot be ignored.

        Goal of this change is to limit usage of GraphicsContextState directly
        in operations implemented inside the Cairo namespace. Instead, the
        state parameters should be passed directly, or an equivalent but limited
        state object should be constructed for invocation of such operations.

        This is likely only an intermediate solution. It's possible it will be
        replaced by a more complete shadow state struct that would be used for
        any operation that is required to draw shadows, if necessary.

        Add a LayoutDisallowedScope to check that Document::absoluteRegionForEventTargets() doesn't

        Storage Access API: Refactor to make naming accurate and explicit, simplify access table, and prepare for access removal for page

        No new tests. The only changed functionality that isn't covered
        by existing tests is cross-origin iframes in the same partition
        should be handled as already having access. This cannot be
        tested in layout tests since they don't support subdomains.

        This change does the following:
        - Changes function and message names to reflect how this feature
          was eventually implemented, i.e. access per frame.
        - Makes it explicit that the UI process is only involved in
          granting storage access and not removing storage access.
          The latter is done directly by the web process.
        - Simplifies the network process' entry map since only needs to
          be able to give access to one domain in one frame at a time.
          Access goes away on frame navigation so there can only be one
          domain at a time per frame. Also, the map now uses pageIDs as
          main keys to prepare for efficient access removal for all
          frames under a page.
        - Fixes a bug in so that a cross-origin iframe with the same
          partition as the top frame correctly is handled as already
          having access.

        Web Inspector: Capture Element Screenshot looks fuzzy
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=175734
        <rdar://problem/33803377>

        Reviewed by Joseph Pecoraro and Simon Fraser.

        Screenshots taken by Web Inspector were being downscaled from the
        internal size to the logical size, causing them to be blurry when
        later upscaled to the internal size.

        Replace ScaleBehavior { Scaled, Unscaled } with PreserveResolution { No, Yes }.
        This is a lot less confusing to read both inside ImageBuffer and at its use sites.

        Remove unused CoordinateSystem argument for ImageBuffer::toDataURL,
        and replace it with PreserveResolution. Plumb PreserveResolution into toCFData
        so that PreserveResolution::Yes will preserve the internal size of
        the image buffer, just as it does in other methods that take PreserveResolution.

        At the use site in InspectorPageAgent, always request PreserveResolution::Yes snapshots
        when taking an element screenshot. For now, keep using downscaled (smaller)
        snapshots when capturing canvas previews, as the previews are not full-size.

        Floats can overhang multiple blocks (they are called intruding floats).
        Each block keeps track of such intruding floats. When an overhanging float box is destroyed,
        we need to deregister it from all those blocks. We do it by walking up the ancestor block chain
        and check if the parent (grandparent etc) block still contains this float. Once we find the topmost block, 
        we start deregistering it by traversing back on the descendant blocks.
        Normally we do it in RenderElement::takeChildInternal right before the box is getting detached.
        However in certain cases (like when the float's parent happens to be an anonymous wrapper)
        by the time we get to ::takeChildInternal the subtree is already detached and we can't access all the
        ancestors.
        This patch ensure that the floating box is still attached during de-registration.

        paths associated with any item on the pasteboard, fetch a PasteboardItemInfo at a given item index, which

        Teach the iOS Pasteboard to read web content using attachment elements, if enabled. There are two scenarios in
        which we would want to insert an attachment element:
        (1) The item provider uses a preferred presentation style of attachment, in which case we bail out of trying to
            handle the drop using the default mechanisms, and simply insert it as an attachment. We need this to deal
            with the case where we drop text or HTML files from the Files app, so that we don't try and insert the
            contents of the text or HTML as inline web content.
        (2) The item provider doesn't have a preferred attachment presentation style, but there's nothing WebKit would
            otherwise do with the dropped content, so insert an attachment element as a fallback. Examples where this is
            relevant are dropping a PDF or ZIP archive without attachment presentation style explicitly set.
        We first check if we fall into case (1). If so, we can bail early by inserting an attachment; otherwise, we
        proceed normally and see if we can read the contents of the drop as web content. If, at the end of default drop
        handling, we don't still have a way to represent the dropped content, enter case (2).

        file, so we don't end up creating multiple attachment elements for each representation of a single item

        using attachment elements as a fallback representation, if the source writes attributed strings to the
        pasteboard with com.apple.rtfd at a higher fidelity than com.apple.flat-rtfd, we'll end up loading only
        com.apple.rtfd and dropping the text as an attachment element because we cannot convert the dropped content to
        markup. Instead, if flat RTFD is present in the item provider, always prefer that over RTFD so that dropping as
        regular web content isn't overridden when attachment elements are enabled.

        [Attachment Support] Add plumbing for starting a drag with promised blob data
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=181201

        Reviewed by Tim Horton.

        Adds logic to allow dragging an attachment element as a file by sending promised blob information to the UI
        process. See comments below for more detail.

        The only change in behavior is that dragging an attachment element will no longer write web content and injected
        bundle data to the pasteboard if the attachment element's file attribute is nonnull. This will cause one
        existing WK1 layout test to fail, but will otherwise not affect any attachment editing clients. On iOS,
        attachment elements in the Mail viewer can be dragged, but each attachment's file is null, so we fall back to
        current behavior; on macOS, Mail currently overrides the drag completely, beginning at -mouseDown:, so this
        doesn't make a difference to macOS Mail either.

        network process for performance reasons and to minimize the risk of a
        race.

        As a consequence, the XPC code for storage access removal in the UI
        process is deleted.

            Figuring this out will take some work which is unnecessary

        feLighting is broken with primitiveUnits="objectBoundingBox"
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=181197

        Reviewed by Tim Horton.

        With <filter primitiveUnits="objectBoundingBox"> we need to convert the coordinates
        of fePointLights and feSpotLights into user space coordinates. Following
        https://www.w3.org/TR/SVG/filters.html#FilterElementPrimitiveUnitsAttribute
        this is done by treating them as fractions of the bounding box on the referencing
        element, with treatment for z following https://www.w3.org/TR/SVG/coords.html#Units_viewport_percentage
        
        To do this, store the bounds of the referencing elemenet on SVGFilterBuilder as
        targetBoundingBox, and store the primitiveUnits type. Then do the conversion of lighting
        coordinates in SVGFESpecularLightingElement::build() and SVGFEDiffuseLightingElement::build().

        Remove SVGFELightElement::findLightSource(), since we need to be able to pass the SVGFilterBuilder
        to the lightSource() function so hoist the code up.

        SVG lighting filter lights are in the wrong coordinate system
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=181147

        Reviewed by Zalan Bujtas.

        Point and spot light coordinates weren't being converted into buffer-relative
        coordinates before being fed into the lighting math, resulting in incorrect light
        rendering on Retina devices, and when the filter primitive region was clipped.

        Fix by storing absoluteUnclippedSubregion on FilterEffect, which allows us to map
        lighting points from user space coordinates into the coordinates of the buffer being
        used for rendering. Also scale the light z coordinate by doing a dummy point mapping in x.

        Rename members of PointLightSource and SpotLightSource to make it clear which coordinate
        system they are in.

        PromisedBlobInfo. The content may either be in the form of a file path (as is the case using the previous
        declareAndWriteAttachment codepath) or a data buffer (which we would use if the Blob is not already backed by a
        file on disk).

        No new tests, since there is no observable change in functionality yet.

        Clients such as Mail would expect pasting or dropping an image with src="https://..." to result in the source
        URL being preserved (i.e. staying as remote images) instead of creating image attachments out of them. This
        patch hooks into the shouldConvertToBlob() check added in r226272 so that it applies to attachment element
        replacement as well.

        No new tests (Behavior change covered by all existing tests).

        This cleans up the abstract MessagePortChannel interface to be in terms of identifiers
        instead of actual MessagePort objects.
        
        The identifiers are compounded with the current ProcessIdentifier meaning they are global
        across all processes for the running UI process, enabling easy cross-process communication.
