            StyleSheetContents::wrapperInsertRule() can create rules that overflow RuleData's selector index
            https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=147144

            Reviewed by Alex Christensen.

            RuleData identifies selectors by the index in a large array. The index only has 13 bits
            so rules with more than 8192 selectors should be split.

            One of the paths was not splitting the rule: StyleSheetContents::wrapperInsertRule().
            When rules with too many selectors were added, the index would overflow and
            some RuleData would point to selectors in the middle of selector chains. The resulting
            behavior is random based on the selectors and the DOM.

            We cannot easily fix that because the CSS OM API do not expect to create
            several rules in response to calls to the API.
            In this patch, I don't do anything fancy and just let the calls fail
            if we cannot use the rules safely.


            Content Extensions were also running into this problem. Large Selector lists are
            pretty common, and ContentExtensionStyleSheet::addDisplayNoneSelector() was
            overflowing the RuleData, creating broken page.

            Unlike CSSOM, there is no problem with splitting rules coming from Content Extensions.
            Instead of creating new APIs for that case, I rely on the parser to extend the StyleSheetContents.
            That code already knows how to break rules correctly.

            REGRESSION (r172417, r184065): Multiple rendering issues with fixed attached background-image
            https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=147049
            <rdar://problem/21110936>

            Reviewed by Simon Fraser.

            The fixed-attached background-image rendering is special. In general, to
            display it, the destinationSize should be set to visibleContentSize. The
            destinationLocation should be set such that the background-image does
            not move with scrolling. The topContentInset should be subtracted from
            the destinationLocation such that background-image can be rendered blurred
            in the topContentArea. However there are cases in which these rules have to
            be changed.

            -- destinationSize: In the case of fixed layout size, the fixedLayoutSize
            is bigger than the visibleContentSize. In this case, if the background-image
            belongs to the root element, the destinationSize has to be set to fixedLayoutSize.
            Otherwise it has to be set to the borderBoxSize unless the overflow is
            hidden.

            -- destinationLocation: If the background-image belongs to the root element, no
            scroll offset to added to destinationLocation. For non-root element case,
            FrameView::documentScrollOffsetRelativeToViewOrigin() should be used if no page
            scaling is applied. Otherwise FrameView::scrollOffsetForFixedPosition() should be
            used instead.

            Since the thumb is positioned after the layout for the input (shadow) subtree is finished, the repaint rects

            We need to issue a repaint soon after the thumb is re-positioned.
