            REGRESSION (r172417, r184065): Multiple rendering issues with fixed attached background-image
            https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=147049

            The fixed-attached background-image rendering is special. In general, to
            display it, the destinationSize should be set to visibleContentSize. The
            destinationLocation should be set such that the background-image does
            not move with scrolling. The topContentInset should be subtracted from
            the destinationLocation such that background-image can be rendered blurred
            in the topContentArea. However there are cases in which these rules have to
            be changed.

            -- destinationSize: In the case of fixed layout size, the fixedLayoutSize
            is bigger than the visibleContentSize. In this case, if the background-image
            belongs to the root element, the destinationSize has to be set to fixedLayoutSize.
            Otherwise it has to be set to the borderBoxSize unless the overflow is
            hidden.

            -- destinationLocation: If the background-image belongs to the root element, no
            scroll offset to added to destinationLocation. For non-root element case,
            FrameView::documentScrollOffsetRelativeToViewOrigin() should be used if no page
            scaling is applied. Otherwise FrameView::scrollOffsetForFixedPosition() should be
            used instead.

            Since the thumb is positioned after the layout for the input (shadow) subtree is finished, the repaint rects
            issued during the layout will not cover the re-positioned thumb.
            We need to issue a repaint soon after the thumb is re-positioned.
