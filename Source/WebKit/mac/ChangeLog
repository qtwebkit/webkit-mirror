            REGRESSION (r182648): UIWebView does not set location.hash synchronously

            Reviewed by Darin Adler.

            The problem was that the delegate in UI thread became asynchronous due to calling
            into LaunchServices.

            * WebCoreSupport/WebFrameLoaderClient.mm: (shouldTryAppLink): Don't attempt app
            links for same domain navigations. This check is part of substantially more complicated
            logic in WebKit2 that I don't understand, but that should be enough to demonstrate
            that this fix is an improvement at least.
