# Stitch Marker: Threading Benchmarks

Stitch Marker is a collection of threading benchmarks. It measures an abstract
machine's low-level capabilities for atomic instructions, higher-level waiting,
and general scalability under contention. It collects state-of-the-art
approaches to locking and lock-free code as well as older approaches, and a few
naive ones because in the real world everyone loses a stitch or two from time to
time. The point isn't to compare different lock implementations, or fancy
lock-free algorithms, it's rather to compare how they lower onto different
(virtual) ISAs.


# Benchmarks

## FMJS Litmus

* Author: Cristian Mattarei
* Benchmark: [FMJS EMME](https://github.com/FMJS/EMME) litmus tests
* Version: FIXME
* Note: FIXME once we have a version which can target WebAssembly

These tests define the boundary of correctness for the JavaScript
SharedArrayBuffer memory model, which WebAssembly mostly re-uses. The tests
themselves are probabilistic in that the programs are run and their outcome is
validated against a list of known-allowed outcomes. Running the tests many times
will, over time, find any implementation flaws.

Running these tests in a loop has attractive properties typical microbenchmarks
do not have: it validates that an implementation can perform as fast as possible
at the boundary of correctness, but no faster. By definition this microbenchmark
*cannot* be gamed because doing so out cause it to fail.

Facebook's folly library has multiple classes related to concurrency and
parallelism, and benchmark many of them.

structures for the research, design and implementation of high performance
concurrent systems.
