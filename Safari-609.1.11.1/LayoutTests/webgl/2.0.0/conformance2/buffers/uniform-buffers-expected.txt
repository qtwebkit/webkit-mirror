This test runs the WebGL Test listed below in an iframe and reports PASS or FAIL.

Test: ../../resources/webgl_test_files/conformance2/buffers/uniform-buffers.html
[ 1: PASS ] WebGL context exists
[ 2: PASS ] gl.getParameter(gl.UNIFORM_BUFFER_BINDING) is null
[ 3: FAIL ] getError expected: NO_ERROR. Was INVALID_ENUM : UNIFORM_BUFFER_BINDING query should succeed
[ 4: PASS ] getError was expected value: NO_ERROR : createBuffer should not set an error
[ 5: PASS ] b1 is non-null.
[ 6: PASS ] b2 is non-null.
[ 7: PASS ] getError was expected value: NO_ERROR : should be able to bind uniform buffer
[ 8: FAIL ] gl.getParameter(gl.UNIFORM_BUFFER_BINDING) should be [object WebGLBuffer]. Was null.
[ 9: FAIL ] getError expected: NO_ERROR. Was INVALID_ENUM : should be able to update uniform buffer binding
[ 10: FAIL ] gl.getParameter(gl.UNIFORM_BUFFER_BINDING) should be [object WebGLBuffer]. Was null.
[ 11: FAIL ] getError expected: NO_ERROR. Was INVALID_ENUM : should be able to unbind uniform buffer
[ 12: PASS ] gl.getParameter(gl.UNIFORM_BUFFER_BINDING) is null
[ 13: FAIL ] getError expected: INVALID_OPERATION. Was INVALID_ENUM : binding a deleted buffer should generate INVALID_OPERATION
[ 14: PASS ] gl.getParameter(gl.UNIFORM_BUFFER_BINDING) is null
[ 15: PASS ] To define the same uniform in two uniform blocks should fail
[ 16: PASS ] UNIFORM_BUFFER_OFFSET_ALIGNMENT is divisible by four
[ 17: FAIL ] successfullyParsed should be true (of type boolean). Was undefined (of type undefined).
[ FAIL ] 7 failures reported
