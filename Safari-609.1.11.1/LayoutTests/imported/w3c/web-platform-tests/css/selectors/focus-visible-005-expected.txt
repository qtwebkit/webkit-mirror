If the user-agent does not claim to support the :focus-visible pseudo-class then SKIP this test.
Click the button below that says "Click me."
If the element that says "I will be focused programmatically." does not have a green background, then the test result is FAILURE. If the element has a green background, then the test result is SUCCESS.

Click me.
I will be focused programmatically.

FAIL Programmatic focus should always match :focus-visible assert_equals: expected "rgb(128, 196, 128)" but got "rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)"
