drawImage() of a canvas with no context draws pixels as (0,0,0,0), and does not leave the pixels unchanged.


FAIL drawImage() of a canvas with no context draws pixels as (0,0,0,0), and does not leave the pixels unchanged. null is not an object (evaluating 'ctx.fillStyle = 'rgba(0, 255, 255, 0.5)'')
