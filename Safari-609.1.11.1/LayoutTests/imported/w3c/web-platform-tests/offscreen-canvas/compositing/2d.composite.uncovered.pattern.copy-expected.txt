Pattern fill() draws pixels not covered by the source object as (0,0,0,0), and does not leave the pixels unchanged.


FAIL Pattern fill() draws pixels not covered by the source object as (0,0,0,0), and does not leave the pixels unchanged. null is not an object (evaluating 'ctx.fillStyle = 'rgba(0, 255, 255, 0.5)'')
