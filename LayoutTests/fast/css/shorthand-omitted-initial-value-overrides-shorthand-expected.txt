Test that initial values implicitly set via a shorthand property override previously defined shorthand properties.

On success, you will see a series of "PASS" messages, followed by "TEST COMPLETE".


Transition properties
PASS transition-property
PASS transition-duration
PASS transition-timing-function
PASS transition-delay

Prefixed transition properties
PASS transition-property

Animation properties
FAIL expected that setting "animation-name: foo; animation: 1s;" would compute animation-name to "none" but got "foo"
FAIL expected that setting "animation-duration: 1s; animation: none;" would compute animation-duration to "0s" but got "1s"
FAIL expected that setting "animation-timing-function: linear; animation: none;" would compute animation-timing-function to "ease" but got "linear"
FAIL expected that setting "animation-iteration-count: 5; animation: none;" would compute animation-iteration-count to "1" but got "5"
FAIL expected that setting "animation-direction: reverse; animation: none;" would compute animation-direction to "normal" but got "reverse"
FAIL expected that setting "animation-play-state: paused; animation: none;" would compute animation-play-state to "running" but got "paused"
FAIL expected that setting "animation-delay: 1s; animation: none;" would compute animation-delay to "0s" but got "1s"
FAIL expected that setting "animation-fill-mode: forwards; animation: none;" would compute animation-fill-mode to "none" but got "forwards"

Prefixed animation properties
PASS -webkit-animation-name
FAIL expected that setting "-webkit-animation-name: foo; animation: none;" would compute animation-name to "none" but got "foo"
PASS -webkit-animation-name
FAIL expected that setting "animation-name: foo; animation: none;" would compute animation-name to "none" but got "foo"
