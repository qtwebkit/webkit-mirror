This tests all the cases where nameFrom: author is used instead of nameFrom: contents. This means that if these elements are used in aria-labelledby they should not return their inner text. The button should retain its aria-label as the description.

On success, you will see a series of "PASS" messages, followed by "TEST COMPLETE".
