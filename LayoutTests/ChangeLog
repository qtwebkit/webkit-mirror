            (display: block)input range's thumb disappears when moved.

            Since the thumb is positioned after the layout for the input (shadow) subtree is finished, the repaint rects
            issued during the layout will not cover the re-positioned thumb.
            We need to issue a repaint soon after the thumb is re-positioned.
