        Do not insert positioned renderers to multiple gPositionedDescendantsMap.

        Reviewed by Simon Fraser.

        We insert positioned renderers into a static map (RenderBlock::gPositionedDescendantsMap) to keep track of them.
        This static map is at block level. A particular absolute positioned object is added to its closest ancestor that
        returns true for RenderElement::canContainAbsolutelyPositionedObjects().
        canContainAbsolutelyPositionedObjects() returns true if the ancestor is either positioned or has transform.
        If this container's style changes so that it's no longer positioned and it has no transform anymore,
        we need to clear its static map of positioned objects (they'll get re-inserted to another ancestor at next layout).

        This patch addresses the case when the renderer does not have transforms anymore.

        The test case is from Blink r175601:
        https://codereview.chromium.org/317513002
        The test case will generate a set of weird ordering events that affects the documentLoader:
        1. The subframe finishes loading, and since the frame’s testRunner is not set to wait until
        done, WebKitTestRunner stops the load (by calling WKBundlePageStopLoading()).
        2. This causes the in-progress XHR to be aborted, which causes its readyState to become DONE
        (this bug doesn’t always reproduce because sometimes the XHR has already finished before the
        frame finishes loading).
        3. The onreadystatechange callback is executed, which sets innerHTML on the parent frame.
        4. Setting innerHTML disconnects the subframe, nulling out its DocumentLoader.
        5. We return to WebFrameLoaderClient::dispatchDidFinishLoad() from step #1, but now the
        FrameLoader’s DocumentLoader is null. And WebKit crashes here.

        Note that steps 2-4 happen synchronously inside WebFrameLoaderClient::dispatchDidFinishLoad().

        Continuations with anonymous wrappers inside misplaces child renderers.
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=150908

        When a child is appended to an inline container and the beforeChild is not a direct child, but 
        it is inside a generated subtree, we need to special case the inline split to form continuation.

        RenderInline::splitInlines() assumes that beforeChild is always a direct child of the current
        inline container. However when beforeChild type requires wrapper content (such as table cells), the DOM and the
        render tree get out of sync. In such cases, we need to ensure that both the beforeChild and its siblings end up
        in the correct generated block.

        rdar://problem/22785262

        Reviewed by Beth Dakin.

        Autosizing initiates multiple synchronous layouts to calculate preferred view width for current content.
        FrameView::autoSizeIfEnabled() is called from FrameView::layout() while we are in InPreLayout state.
        It is safe to do during full layout.
        However, since we setup the subtree state just before the autoSizeIfEnabled() call, reentering it with
        a newly issued layout confuses SubtreeLayoutStateMaintainer.

        This patch reverses the order of autoSizeIfEnabled() call and the subtree layout state setup.
        It also ensures that the first layout requested by autoSizeIfEnabled() always runs on the whole tree.

        When initial-letter float is present, we should shrink the first
        line even if it's not intersected with the block's current height.
        This is because of the sunken behaviour of initial-letter.

        When due to some style change, a renderer's self-painting layer is getting destroyed 
        and the parent's overflow is no longer set to visible, we don't clean up the overflow part.

        When a renderer has a self-painting layer, the parent stops tracking the child's 
        visual overflow rect. All overflow painting is delegated to the self-painting layer.
        However when this layer gets destroyed, no-one issues repaint to clean up
        the overflow bits.
        This patch ensures that we issue a repaint when the self-painting layer is destroyed
        and the triggering style change requires full repaint.

        Reviewed by Joseph Pecoraro.

        In preparation for sharing the same test harness API between protocol tests
        and frontend tests, this patch refactors ProtocolTest into the desired
        class structure. Each type of test (currently: protocol, frontend) extends
        InjectedTestHarness and fills in a few key methods for communicating with
        the test page-side code.

        This patch standardizes on assert() only logging when the condition is false.
        Update protocol tests to use ProtocolTestHarness.expectThat, rather than assert.

        Web Inspector: use different namespaces in test fixtures for protocol tests and frontend tests
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=147787

        Reviewed by Timothy Hatcher.

        Refactor test methods to use three distinct namespaces to reflect their implementation:

        - InspectorProtocol contains commands that are only used from within protocol tests.
        This includes sending and receiving protocol messages and checking message errors.

        - InspectorTest contains test methods for full inspector frontend tests.

        - ProtocolTest contains test methods for protocol tests.

        In a subsequent patch, most methods in InspectorTest and ProtocolTest namespaces
        will be unified so that implementations of log, assert, etc. are no longer duplicated.
        For now, at least make it obvious at each callsite what code is being invoked.

        Shadows don't draw on fillText when using a gradient fill
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=147758

        New test that exercises shadows on gradient fills. This really
        should be a ref test, but there is a very small rendering difference
        caused by masking, so instead it uses JS to look for pixels of
        the correct color.

        Web Inspector: move http/tests/inspector-protocol/ contents to http/tests/inspector/
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=147739

        Reviewed by Timothy Hatcher.

        Start merging inspector-protocol/ directory into inspector/, starting with http tests.

        This patch puts the few http tests into their own domain directories. Files related
        to the test harness have been moved to the appropriate resources/ directory.
        Update all inspector tests to the new paths.

        Lastly, rename InspectorTest.js and protocol-test.html to ProtocolTestStub, to make
        it obvious that these files are only used by the protocol test harness.

        Web Inspector: rewrite protocol test for console messages from X-Frame-Options
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=147714

        Reviewed by Joseph Pecoraro.

        Rewrite deny-X-FrameOption.html to use AsyncTestSuite, and hopefully address
        the flakiness of the test. It is now in the inspector-protocol/console/ directory.

        Extract the addConsoleTestCase helper to a shared file. Clean up console test
        helpers and use a less awkward namespace for these helpers.

        * TestExpectations: Unskip the deleted test, the new test should be less flaky.

        AX: tree item children returned from ranged getter are different from full array of children
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=147660

        Add an isTreeItem() check in ranged element getter so that it matches the logic in 
        the getter for the full children array. This prevents returning a row as a child
        when only the rows contents should be returned. This prevents navigation issues on
        websites without aria outlines.

        Subframes with no current HistoryItem should not prevent page-caching

        Add a layout test that covers page-caching of a page that contains an
        iframe with no current HistoryItem. The sub-frame has no current
        HistoryItem because its URL is invalid: "http://".

        New test.

        * platform/mac-wk1/TestExpectations:
        Skip the new test on Mac WK1. The page is still not cacheable on Mac WK1
        because WebFrameLoaderClient::canCachePage() returns false if the frame
        does not contain HTML at the moment.

        Unreviewed gardening. Marked appcache test as flakey.

        I was unable to reduce flakiness of this in an acceptable fashion,
        just mark it as pass/fail.

        Reviewed by Andreas Kling.

        The bug is very old, there were a lot of tests to update.

        The tests in css3/shapes are incorrect W3C tests. I only updated the expected
        results.

        The test fast/css/getPropertyValue-returns-empty-on-missing-property.html
        is the new one covering the bug fix.

        Rubber-stamped by Benjamin Poulain.

        Tests introduced in r187489 are flaky, they sometimes print the console
        message, sometimes not. The reason is that we sometimes use a cached
        parsed stylesheet and we do not print the warning in this case. To fix
        the flakiness, we now clear the memory cache at the beginning of each
        test to make sure we download and parse the stylesheets.

        promise when the desired protocol event is dispatched.

        -In ContentExtensions, large selectors are now working correctly. The tests

        Reviewed by Anders Carlsson.

        PluginProxy::handleMouseEvent() forwards the generated mouse event to PluginControllerProxy
        using a synchronous message, but the recipient always reply immediately with the same value("true")
        even before handling the received message. So I think PluginProxy::handleMouseEvent() is perfectly
        OK to process its messages asynchronously.

        Web Inspector: start using Promises to handle asynchronous steps in protocol tests
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=147096

        Reviewed by Joseph Pecoraro.

        Existing protocol tests use lots of reinvented wheels to run
        multiple asynchronous tests. This patch begins consolidation of
        these redundant wheels, using a tiny test framework based on
        promises.

        The first change is to introduce InspectorTest.awaitCommand,
        which returns a promise that is fulfilled or rejected if the command
        succeeds or fails. This is the building block for writing protocol
        tests with promises.

        The second change is the introduction of InspectorTest.AsyncTestSuite.
        This properly chains together multiple asynchronous test methods
        using the promise interface. A synchronous version is also added.

        To demonstrate how async tests can be written using this new approach,
        this patch converts existing protocol test. Test coverage for the
        new frameworks also demonstrates their use.

        [ES6] Add support for block scope const

        Reviewed by Filip Pizlo.

        "const" variables do not live on the global object. They
        are only available in the "Program" (read: JavaScript file or
        script tag) that they're defined in. Tests have been updated
        accordingly to switch the "const" variables assumed to be globals
        into "var"s. "var" declared variables in the top level scope
        of a program do live on the global object.

        REGRESSION (r169105): Do not assign a renderer to multiple selection subtrees.

        rdar://problem/21819351

        Reviewed by David Kilzer.

        A renderer should never be assigned to multiple selection subtrees. (Currently RenderObject maintains the last selection state.)
        RenderView::applySubtreeSelection() loops from the start to the end of the selection to find renderers that are inside the selection.
        However, in case of regions (when multiple selection roots are present) traversing the renderer tree by calling RenderObject::nextInPreOrder() could
        end up going across selection roots.
        This patch ensures that we assign renderers to a specific selection only when the current selection root and the renderer's selection root match.

        Since the thumb is positioned after the layout for the input (shadow) subtree is finished, the repaint rects
        issued during the layout will not cover the re-positioned thumb.
        We need to issue a repaint soon after the thumb is re-positioned.

        When the parent iframe is set to display: none, we destroy the associated renderer (RenderIFrame).
        However if the child frame is mutated the same time, during layout we try to access this RenderIFrame
        to check whether it needs frame flattening.
        This patch checks whether the parent render widget is still valid.

        REGRESSION(169105): CSS Regions: renderer returns wrong selection root when it is inside a column flow.
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=146529
        rdar://problem/21613670

        Reviewed by Mihnea Ovidenie and David Kilzer.

        This patch ensures that RenderObject::selectionRoot() handles column flows properly while searching for the associated
        selection root.
        When the renderer is inside a column flow and the column flow is part of a named flow, we stop
        traversing the ancestor chain, searching for the selection root, when we reach the column flow.
        Since the column flow is not a selection root, we mistakenly fall back to the RenderView as selection root.
        Instead, we should check if the column is inside a named flow and return the selection root accordingly.
        Returning the wrong selection root confuses RenderView::splitSelectionBetweenSubtrees() logic and this particular
        RenderObject could end up in multiple selection trees.

        Add tests to ensure that we exempt nodes in a user agent shadow tree from the Content Security Policy (CSP) of the page.

        we do not bypass the CSP of the page for a script that executes in an isolated world and renamed the

        Frame flattening: Hit-testing an iframe could end up destroying the associated inline tree context.
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=146447
        rdar://problem/20613501

        Reviewed by Simon Fraser.

        This patch ensures that the render tree associated with the document on which
        the hit-test is initiated does not get laid out, unless it was directly mutated prior to the hittest.

        Hit-test requirements:
        1. A clean the render tree before hit-testing gets propagated to the renderers.
        Document::updateLayout() ensures it by calling both updateStyleIfNeeded() and layout() not only on the current tree, but also
        on the ancestors if needed.

        2. No render tree mutation while hit-testing the renderers.

        When an iframe is being hit-tested, this hit-test could bubble down to the child frame's render view.
        In order to ensure #1, we call Document::updateLayout() on the current (subframe) document.
        If updateStyleIfNeeded() mutates the render tree, we mark it dirty for layout(). However frame flattening also
        marks the parent renderer (RenderIFrame) dirty.
        While calling layout() to clean the current render tree, we end up laying out the parent tree too.
        Laying out the parent tree could end up destroying the inline tree context from where the
        hittest just bubbled down. (InlineFlowBox -> RenderWidget -> RenderView).

        This patch protects the render tree from such unintentional inline tree mutation during hittesting.
        After the initial layout we set a layout disallow flag on the frame view to defer subsequent layouts.
        This patch only changes behavior when frame flattening is enabled, but in future we may always want to enable this.

        LayoutTests/http/tests/security/contentSecurityPolicy/media-src-track-block.html always passes
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=146272

        Reviewed by Darin Adler.

        Fixes an issue where the test LayoutTests/http/tests/security/contentSecurityPolicy/media-src-track-block.html
        will always pass regardless of whether the Content Security Policy <meta> tag is present because
        the external text track file is not valid WebVTT-formatted file.

        The test verifies that the external text track file LayoutTests/http/tests/security/contentSecurityPolicy/resources/track.vtt
        fails to load when the Content Security Policy of the page disallows loading of all media (media-src: "none")
        by listening for a DOM error event to be dispatched to the <track>. And the text track file is not a valid
        WebVTT-formatted file. So, it will always fail to load; => a DOM error event is always dispatched to the
        <track>; => the test always passes.

        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=146116
        rdar://problem/20959369

        Reviewed by Brent Fulgham.

        This patch ensures that we don't adjust the selection unless the visual selection still matches this subtree root.

        When multiple selection roots are present we need to ensure that a RenderObject
        only shows up in one of them.
        RenderView::splitSelectionBetweenSubtrees(), as the name implies, splits the
        selection and sets the selection range (start/end) on each selection root.
        However, SelectionSubtreeRoot::adjustForVisibleSelection() later recomputes the range
        based on visible selection and that could end up collecting renderers as selection start/end
        from another selection subtree.
        RenderObject's holds the last selection state (RenderObject::setSelectionState).
        If we set a renderer first as "on selection border" and later "inside" using multiple selection roots,
        we can't clean up selections properly when this object gets destroyed.
        One of the roots ends up with a dangling RenderObject pointer.

        REGRESSION (r185809): fast/css-grid-layout/flex-content-sized-columns-resize.html hangs on WK1

        Since window.resize() occurs in the same runloop as the load on
        WK1, testRunner.notifyDone() would never get called.

        * fast/css-grid-layout/flex-content-sized-columns-resize.html:
        Call document.body.offsetTop to ensure layout occurs at the
        initial window size before calling window.resize().

        fast/css-grid-layout/flex-content-sized-columns-resize.html is flaky

        The Flakiness Dashboard says this test is flaky on Apple and EFL
        WebKit2 platforms:

        <http://webkit-test-results.appspot.com/dashboards/flakiness_dashboard.html#showAllRuns=true&tests=fast%2Fcss-grid-layout%2Fflex-content-sized-columns-resize.html>

        It currently doesn't wait for window.resize() to complete, which
        is likely the source of flakiness.

        * fast/css-grid-layout/flex-content-sized-columns-resize.html:
        Switch to using notifyDone() inside a window.onresize function,
        and make the test work in a web browser without TestRunner.

        Reviewed by Darin Adler.

        Considered all changes in the spec tests and brought them to WebKit.

        Some of those changes were related to spec changes, like the strategy or some of the algorithms. Some like the
        tee ones were newly added as they will be implemented soon. There are also some tests that shuffled around
        because they were just moved at the spec or integrated from the changes we submitted, which was substantially
        important as it allowed us to remove some of our custom tests that are now covered by the spec ones.

        Too many flaky tests happens on efl bot when enabling USE_NATIVE_XDISPLAY and DISPLAY.
        Those options were enabled for removing TextureMapperImageBuffer. However now EFL Layout Test
        can be run without enabling the options. To remove many flaky tests, EFL buildbot disables
        the env variables.

        Thanks to disable it, many tests can be unskipped which were marked to failure, imageonlyfailure
        and so on since r183540.

        [CSS Grid Layout] Add some more testing for grid line names
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=145691

        Reviewed by Darin Adler.

        After moving to the new syntax which uses brackets instead of
        parentheses for grid line names lists, it's good to improve a bit
        the testing of the feature with some more new test cases.

        Subpixel rendering: Composited layer with subpixel gap does not get painted properly when its position changes.
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=145587

        Reviewed by Simon Fraser.

        The composited layer always snaps to an enclosing device pixel (floors) while the renderer rounds.
        At certain positions (for example 0.5px on a 1x display), a gap is formed between the layer(0px) and its renderer(1px).
        In such cases, when the the renderer moves to a position (1.1px) where the gap is closed, we need to issue repaint on the layer
        in order to get the renderering right.

        Backdrop filter is pulling in content from behind the window.
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=145561
        rdar://problem/20909309

        Reviewed by Simon Fraser.

        This patch ensures that the backdrop filter layer is positioned and sized properly.

        The backdrop filter layer should take its size and position from its renderer and not
        directly from the composited layer.
        In certain cases the composited layer's size is expanded to cover items like box shadow or an absolute positioned descendant.
        In such cases, we ended up applying the backdrop filter to those areas as well.

        Fix Mac Mavericks layout test failure following <http://trac.webkit.org/changeset/185096>
        (https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=145478)

        Move fast/text/font-weights-zh.html out of the platform directory. The
        webkit test runner is not smart enough to ignore the expected results

        This patch ensures that overlap testing for composited layers works properly when the sibling
        layer gets composited through its child.

        When a layer gets composited through its child content, the recursive overlap testing should build up the
        overlapmap stack so that sibling content is intersected both against the child and its parent bounds.

        This patch also moves fast/ruby/ruby-expansion-cjk*.html to platform/mac because they rely on

        Overhanging float sets are not cleaned up properly when floating renderer is destroyed.
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=145323
        rdar://problem/20980628

        Reviewed by Dave Hyatt.

        This patch ensures when an overhanging float renderer is destroyed,
        all the sibling containers' floating object set(m_floatingObjects) gets properly cleaned up.

        When an overhanging float is present, we cache the renderer on the parent and on the affected
        sibling containers too. (RenderBlockFlow::m_floatingObjects) These caches(sets) get cleared and repopulated
        during ::layout(). In order to have a float renderer removed from a set, a layout needs to be initiated on the container.
        This is normally done through RenderBlockFlow::markSiblingsWithFloatsForLayout() and RenderBlockFlow::markAllDescendantsWithFloatsForLayout().
        However, when the float container's parent's writing direction changes (and we promote the children containers to new formatting contexts),
        the layout propagation through siblings does not work anymore.

        The avoidsFloats() check in RenderBlockFlow::markSiblingsWithFloatsForLayout() has very little performance gain, but it prevents us
        from propagating layout to siblings when certain properties of the parent container changes.

        Merged anonymous blocks should invalidate simple line layout path.
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=145104
        rdar://problem/20980930

        Reviewed by Antti Koivisto.

        When anonymous blocks are merged together, it's not guaranteed that the final block can use simple line layout.
        This patch ensures that the flow block, where the other block's content gets moved to, is no longer on simple line layout path.
        Whether the final flow block ends up using inline boxes or simple line layout will be determined during the next layout.

        Test the interaction between font-family and font-weight
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=145078

        Reviewed by Dean Jackson.

        This test is designed to test the interaction between font-family and font-weight. In particular,
        our implementation of font-family accepts PostScript names, which may name a font with a particular
        weight. However, there is another CSS property, font-weight, in which the author may also name a
        particular weight. Our font selection algorithm takes both of these signals into account when
        choosing fonts.

        There is currently no good way in JavaScript to find the actual font chosen for some text.
        Therefore, the best way to test this aspect of the font selection algorithm is to dump the render
        tree, therefore testing glyph advances (which are a property of font weight).

        Background image geometry calculation needs to be based on the final painting size of the container
        in order to accurately compute tile sizes, repeating positions etc.
        The container's size is pixelsnapped at painting using absolute coordinates. This patch
        ensures that we snap to the same size while computing background geometry.

        Make a copy of the stack-trace test that only runs in run-jsc-stress-tests. Sadly, we don't
        have a good way of having different expectation files for when a test runs in RJST versus
        RWT. So, the approach I take is that I make a copy of the test just for RJST and I exclude
        the .html file, which makes RWT overlook it. The test has different expectations in the
        two harnesses because it does some small DOM things.

        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=144879

        Reviewed by Myles C. Maxfield

        This patch ensures that we use fallback font for the missing space glyph only when the rendered text has space in it.

        If a font does not provide all the glyphs required to render the associated text, we initiate fallback fonts. It is done while
        measuring the text at layout time. However due to the fact that we always pre-measure space, a font with no space glyph in it is never sufficient.
        (even when the text does not require space at all)
        Fallback fonts impact line positions through ascent/descent calculation.

        This patch ensures that the backing store's graphics layer is always positioned on a device pixel boundary.

        While calculating the backing store's graphics layer location, its ancestor layer's compositing bounds is taken into account.
        However the compositing bounds is an unsnapped value, so in order to place the graphics layer properly,
        we need to pixel align the ancestor compositing bounds before using it to adjust the child's graphics layer position.

        In TextIterator::handleTextNode before emitting a string, certain characters (\n \t) need to
        be replaced with space. When such character is found, we emit the string we've processed so far and
        handle the replacement during the next callback.
        When the first character in the string needs replacing, there's nothing to emit. However if we don't
        handle at least one character, TextIterator::advance believes that processing is done and never calls  
        TextIterator::handleTextNode back with the rest of the string.

        When a text fragment overlaps multiple renderes and it does not fit the current line,
        we revert the text fragment iterator position so that the overlapping content
        gets processed again for the next line.
        However, TextFragmentIterator::revertToFragment() was reverting too much and
        we started processing old content all over again -> infinite loop.

        This patch ensures that text fragment iterator is reverted to the right position.

        * js/array-holes-expected.txt: This result now matches Firefox. We see
        'peekaboo', which is a prototype property, rather than a hole, because
        sorting uses [[Get]], which sees prototype properties.

        The ES6 spec says that sorting should use [[Get]], so this new result
        matches the spec a little better -- although the spec also says that the
        result of sorting is undefined in this case because of the presence of
        an indexed property in the prototype chain.

        shorter so that it wouldn't hang debug builds. This test is O(N^2). It
        used to terminate sooner because our sort implementation would (sometimes)
        terminate sooner if you shrank the array. Our new sort does not accept
        intermediate updates to the array's length, matching Firefox. I spoke
        to Gavin and Alexey about this, and we think that going out of our way
        to honor length changes mid-sort doesn't make much sense because it's
        not possible to honor the general case of value changes in a predictable
        way.

        streams/reference-implementation/readable-stream.html is flaky
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=143778

        Unreviewed.

        Comment out flaky subtests while working on a more complete
        solution.

        The problem with these tests is that they set a timeout before the
        calling done() and this causes some tests to behave
        undeterministically, specilly code related to promise
        resolution. This could even cause indetermination if the tests
        were expected to run correctly.

        We think it is better to comment them out and find a more long
        term solution that could involve submitting change requests to the
        reference tests in the spec. This will be tackled in bug 143774.

        This is the full test set that we have for the implementation of
        Streams API. When we add more features/code the number of passing
        tests will increase.

        We have the tests translated from the reference implementation at
        streams/reference-implementation and our own tests for some other
        things at the streams upper level.

        We removed testharness stacktrace in case of failure because it
        dumps the filenames with paths. You can activate it for a specific
        test by setting its dumpStack attribute to true.

        All our former custom tests were integrated in the spec so we they
        are now in their appropriate places in the reference
        implementation ones. Some of them were changed to match the actual
        spec and they are failing now, but we only have to progressively
        fix them.

        Simple line layout: Add <br> support.
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=139012

        This patch enables RenderBlockFlows to use simple line layout on text content when <br> is present.
        Simple text with <br> is a fairly common pattern on discussion(forum)-like web pages. This patch reduces memory usage
        and speeds up layout for such content.

        Test output changes in 2 different ways:
        1. Repositioned RenderLineBreak elements. (1px wide <br> is the result of integral pixel snapping)
        2. Removed empty content (<br>).

        Because sourceURL is now being appended at error construction time rather than when thrown, 
        the tests now attempt to append it during the code run by InspectorTest.sendCommand which I assume uses an eval.
        Because this code is generated on the fly, it has no URL and thus sourceURL makes no sense.
        Also since they are generated in a new locations, they will have a new lines and columns.

        Simple line layout: Add <br> support.
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=139012

        This patch enables RenderBlockFlows to use simple line layout on text content when <br> is present.
        Simple text with <br> is a fairly common pattern on discussion(forum)-like web pages. This patch reduces memory usage
        and speeds up layout for such content.

        Test output changes in 2 different ways:
        1. Repositioned RenderLineBreak elements. (1px wide <br> is the result of integral pixel snapping)
        2. Removed empty content (<br>).

        This test also happens to test the aforementioned setFrameRect change,

        size (800x600) because the scrollbars would be left behind in the resize.

        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=143258

        The test relies on resource priorities. Those don't roundtrip when serializing via NSURLRequest on Mavericks due
        to ResourceRequest::resourcePrioritiesEnabled() returning false.

        It is bit surprising it works on release but not on debug. I suspect some debug code forces NSURLRequest construction
        and so we end up on the roundtrip code path.

        It's wrong to assume that when RenderInline is part of an inline continuation, its containing block
        is an anonymous wrapper and its sibling might be a block level renderer.
        When the inline continuation is no longer needed, for example when the block level renderer that initiated the continuation
        is detached from the render tree, the inline renderes still continue to form continuation.(however they no longer require
        anonymous wrappers)

        Reviewed by Ryosuke Niwa.

        This updates a number of existing tests that were relying on
        poor behavior. `shouldBe` and friends use eval within a function
        not at the global scope. This means `shouldBe('class X { ... }')`
        behaves like `shouldBe('var x = ...')` not `shouldBe('x = ...')`.
        This means `x` will not be available in the next `shouldBe` call.

        Add a test specifically to cover the scoping of the class name
        in regular and strict mode code. Currently we treat it like var
        with one failing test that would pass when we treat it like let.

        Updated these test results to reflect the fact that JavaScriptCore now
        honors the source code text positions provided by WebCore, even for 
        attribute event handlers.

        Unfortunately, the column numbers we used to report were wrong, and they
        are still wrong now. The old column numbers were wrong because we would
        always pretend that they started on column 1. The new column numbers
        are wrong because WebCore records the column number after it finishes
        parsing the element, rather than while it is parsing the event listener
        attribute.

        Reviewed by Chris Fleizach.

        This test doesn't verify the absence of the crash because the crash seems
        to require that an assistive technology is listening for events, and that
        AT-SPI2 is caching the tree for that assistive technology -- something we
        cannot count on being the case on our bots. (I suspect that the reason non-
        assistive technology users of Epiphany were getting hit by this is because
        Caribou was listening for events in the background, thus they were AT users
        without realizing it. That Caribou issue is in theory now resolved.) What
        this test does verify is the absence of children-changed:add accessibility
        signals for non-rendered objects, which is the source of the crash given
        the aforementioned environment.

        Add tests for -0 in different places.
        I don't understand yet why the test says "0" for
        the property previews of "-0". Everything behaves
        correctly, but I can't see to make the test show
        the right value appear in the test. That is worth

        AX: Provide API for assistive tech to ignore DOM key event handlers
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=142059

        Reviewed by Beth Dakin.

        Assistive technology applications on the desktop are heavily dependent on keyboard navigation being reliable. This is greatly hindered by sites that handle key events without updating keyboard selection and then consume the event. It is important for assistive technology apps to allow users to decide to ignore these handlers that are incorrect for their purposes.

        This can be fixed by exposing, via a new accessibility attribute, a way to decide, for a given WebCore::Frame, to pre-empt DOM dispatch and instead let accessibility caret browsing take place.

        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=138366

        Reviewed by Dave Hyatt.

        This patch ensures that we clean up RenderNamedFlowFragment::m_renderObjectRegionStyle when embedded flow content is getting destroyed.

        In m_renderObjectRegionStyle hash map, we store style information about the named flow's descendant children.
        When a child is being detached from the tree, it removes itself from this hashmap.
        We do it by traversing up on the ancestor chain and call removeFlowChildInfo() on the parent flow.
        However in case of embedded flows (for example multicolumn content inside a region), we need to check whether the parent flow
        is inside a flow too and continue the cleanup accordingly.

        Reviewed by Chris Fleizach.

        Exposing the caret browsing setting on WebCore::Frame via the accessibility API would allow assistive tech apps to enable it contextually (for example, when the assistive tech app is running).
        Enabling caret browsing when assistive tech apps are running greatly improves the reliability of keyboard navigation on the web. Most especially in cases where selection would be disrupted by focus events.

        It appears that different control flow paths in probeAndRecurse() allowed the second time
        through the test to recurse deeper before getting to the point of overflowing the stack.
        Restructured the test so that the exact same control flow in probeAndRecurse() is used
        both times we call it, including probing the depth of the stack.  Now we pass a flag that
        indicates whether or not we should try ever expanding eval strings or reuse the most

        DFG JIT needs to check for stack overflow at the start of Program and Eval execution
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=141676

        Reviewed by Filip Pizlo.

        Updated the check for out of stack at eval entry test from using a fixed number of frame to
        back track to now adjust the amount of back tracking up the stack based on where we can run a
        simple eval().  At that point in the stack we try to cause an out of stack exception.

        Also added a second pass of the test that takes the originally failing eval and tiers that
        eval expression up to the DFG when used with the agreessive options of run-jsc-stress-tests.
        This was done to reduce the amount of time the test takes to run in debug builds.

        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=133462

        Reviewed by David Hyatt.

        RenderFlowThread::m_lineToRegionMap stores pointers to the root inlineboxes in the block flow.
        Normally root inlineboxes remove themselves from this map in their dtors. However when collapsing an anonymous block,
        we detach the inline tree first and destroy them after. The detached root boxes can't access
        the flowthread containing block and we end up with dangling pointers in this map.
        Call removeFlowChildInfo() before detaching the subtree to ensure proper pointer removal.

        Make SVGUseElement work without creating any SVGElementInstance objects
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=141374

        Reviewed by Sam Weinig.

        Results changed on some tests that expected the old "remove all content if a cycle is detected"
        behavior from the <use> element. The new behavior is to inhibit cycles, but render everything
        else, which is much easier to implement correctly and also makes logical sense. Changed all
        those tests to be reference tests, which makes sense since they are focusing on what gets
        rendered in these complex cases, and the expected results are a lot easier to understand in
        SVG form than they were in txt/png form. This also means we can remove a lot of platform-specific
        results since reference tests aren't sensitive to small platform differences in rendering.

        Do not destroy RenderQuote's text fragment child when quotation mark string is changing.
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=141271

        Reviewed by Antti Koivisto.

        Similar approach as https://codereview.chromium.org/679593004/

        This patch ensures that laying out a RenderQuote does not force a sibling RenderQuote's
        child renderer(RenderText) to be destroyed.
        BreakingContext holds a pointer to the next renderer on the line (BreakingContext::m_nextObject).
        While laying out the line, initiated by BreakingContext, placing the current renderer could end up destroying the "next" renderer.
        This happens when the pseudo after quotation mark(RenderQuote) becomes floated, the sibling <q>'s pseudo
        before text needs to be changed (from " to ') so that we don't end up with 2 sets of the same opening
        strings.
        The fix is to reuse the RenderTextFragment object instead of destroy/recreate it.

        fast/html/marquee-scrollamount.html is flaky
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=140851

        Reviewed by Darin Adler.

        Updated the test to not have a zero delay timer race. Added many comments, because
        what is being tested here is quite subtle.

        Remove 'font' shorthand property special casing

        * fast/css/CSSPrimitiveValue-font-family-primitiveType-expected.txt: Added.
        * fast/css/CSSPrimitiveValue-font-family-primitiveType.html: Added.
        Add layout test to make sure that the font-family is still exposed to the
        Web as a CSSValueList of CSSPrimitiveValues whose primitiveType is
        CSS_STRING. This is useful because we now use a slightly different
        representation internally.

        * fast/css/font-shorthand-line-height-expected.txt:
        * fast/css/font-shorthand-line-height.html:
        Rebaseline the test. This is a progression. Setting the 'font' property
        to a system font ID is supposed to reset the line-height property to
        'normal'. It previously did not because system font IDs were not
        expanded at parsing time. The new behavior is consistent with Chrome and
        Firefox as well.

        * fast/css/font-systemFontID-parsing-expected.txt: Added.
        * fast/css/font-systemFontID-parsing.html: Added.
        Add a layout test to make sure that the CSS parser is rejecting a 'font'
        property with more than one system font id.

        Rewrite the fast/css/css2-system-fonts.html test to be more useful on all platforms
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=140810

        Reviewed by Andreas Kling.

        Make the fast/css/css2-system-fonts.html explicit about the font styles
        expected on each platform instead of just Mac.

        It also converts the test to be text only as the style information is
        now displayed in text format.

        This change is in preparation for a refactor of system font handling.

        Reviewed by Chris Fleizach.

        The test checks the heuristic to determine if a 'list' is really a list.
        In the area of ATK a role for description list has been separated from the role AXList.
        This made the test stopped giving positive results for ports EFL and GTK.
        The proposed amendment restores test for these ports.

        Updating test expected results.

        svg/W3C-SVG-1.1/fonts-glyph-04-t.svg tests something which isn't spec'ed
        and is impossible to perform with the converter, so I have deleted that
        test.

        svg/custom/skip-underline-missing-glyph-expected.html was testing
        incorrect behavior, so I have updated the test.

        The getStartPositionOfChar() calls in svg/text/kerning.svg and
        svg/text/multichar-glyph.svg are currently impossible to be implemented
        correctly with the converter, so I have updated the expected results to
        test for the updated results of those calls.

        [SVG -> OTF Converter] Flip the switch on

        Updating test expected results.

        svg/W3C-SVG-1.1/fonts-glyph-04-t.svg tests something which isn't spec'ed
        and is impossible to perform with the converter, so I have deleted that
        test.

        svg/custom/skip-underline-missing-glyph-expected.html was testing
        incorrect behavior, so I have updated the test.

        The getStartPositionOfChar() calls in svg/text/kerning.svg and
        svg/text/multichar-glyph.svg are currently impossible to be implemented
        correctly with the converter, so I have updated the expected results to
        test for the updated results of those calls.

        Reviewed by Darin Adler.

        Some messages lost line numbers now. Some of these were definitely wrong, others
        were roughly right. Unfortunately, it is not currently possible to figure out whether
        ScriptController actually executes a script after passing control to it. So the cases
        where it refuses to execute the script and logs a message are handled like those
        where it does.

        I think that it shouldn't be a big obstacle in practice, it is easy enough to find
        a script in a page when Web Inspector tells you that scripts were not allowed.

                t.UsedBreadth = t.MaxBreadth

        That's correct for most of the cases, but it becomes
        wrong whenever t.UsedBreadth > t.MaxBreadth something that is not
        incorrect. What we actually want to do is to grow the track to its
        maximum if and only if the used breadth is smaller than the maximum.

        Reviewed by David Hyatt.

        The third step of the grid track sizing algorithm (method
        ComputeUsedBreadthOfGridTracks in the old specs version of the
        algorithm) tries to grow all grid tracks until the remaining space
        is exhausted. Should the remaining space is undefined we should fill
        the tracks up to their limits. This is specified in pseudocode like
        this:

            For each Grid track t in GridTracks
                t.UsedBreadth = t.MaxBreadth

        That's correct for most of the cases, but it becomes
        wrong whenever t.UsedBreadth > t.MaxBreadth something that is not
        incorrect. What we actually want to do is to grow the track to its
        maximum if and only if the used breadth is smaller than the maximum.

        Reviewed by Simon Fraser.

        When the hit point gets translated beyond the min/max value of LayoutRect (infiniteRect()),
        we fail to find the corresponding layer.
        When there's no clipping on a layer, we use min/max values to represent infiniteness.
        However it does not work well across types. With IntPoint(hittest) we can address a point that's outside
        of LayoutRect's boundary(clipping).
        This patch addresses the immediate issue of not being able to hittest transformed layers properly. 
        Fixing the representation of infiniteness is tracked here: webkit.org/b/140533

        AX: [ATK] Mark accessibility/render-counter-text.html as a suitable test for EFL and GTK.
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=140438

        Reviewed by Chris Fleizach.

        The test shows the text contents of the <li> element with the counter inside <ol> using three childAtIndex().stringValue methods.
        In the case of ATK childAtIndex(0) returns a non-empty object, but it is not the ATK_OBJECT,
        so the stringValue produces an empty string.
        To avoid this, the text content is obtained by direct reading of stringValue of <li> AccessibilityUIElement which is ATK_TEXT.

        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=140355

        Reviewed by Chris Fleizach.

        The test shows the text contents of an AccessibilityTableCell object using tableCell.childAtIndex(0).stringValue.
        In the case of ATK childAtIndex(0) returns a non-empty object, but it is not the ATK_OBJECT,
        so the stringValue produces an empty string.
        To avoid this, the cell text content is obtained by direct reading of stringValue of TableCell.

        Calling clearSelection on a detached RenderObject leads to segfault.
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=140275

        Reviewed by Simon Fraser.

        We collect selection rects and compute selection gaps in order to
        paint/clear selection. With certain content, we need to be able
        to walk the tree up to a particular container to compute the selection rect.
        However this container might not be available when the selection is part of a detached tree.
        This is a null-check fix to ensure we don't crash in such cases, but in the long run
        selection gaps and rect should be cached between two layouts so that we don't need to
        keep collecting/recomputing them. Tracked here: webkit.org/b/140321

        Use only FloatQuad in RenderGeometryMap::mapToContainer.

        Due to the difference in the internal representation of FloatRect and FloatQuad,
        with certain float values, converting FloatRect to FloatQuad and back
        to FloatRect could produce a slightly different rect.

        These tests are very flaky since they expect to be run in order. Furthermore, they were testing a WebKit Mac SPI
        that is pretty hard to test reliably, due to its "design". It's not worth trying to make these tests work
        or to rewrite them in Objective-C (which would be the right thing to do), so just get rid of them.

        Reviewed by Darin Adler.

        1. XHR loads are aborted when a page load starts, not when it's committed (which
        is a known bug in WebKit). This gave the failure timer an opportunity to fire between
        these events. Fixed by extending the delay.

        2. Starting the test while parsing had a potential for a race with loading - we
        could run it before all data was loaded. While this probably didn't happen in
        practice here, it's better to run navigation tests under 100% reproducible conditions,
        like during onload.

        fast/canvas/webgl/angle-instanced-arrays.html is very flaky
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=139958

        Reviewed by Darin Adler.

        WebGL test harness added js-test-post.js in a flaky manner, and to make things worse,
        this test also had its own include of js-test-post.js.

        Looking at the tests, I noticed that the way test harnesses were used was a big mess,
        so I went over the whole directory, making these changes:
        1. Use js-test.js instead of js-test-pre.js, because it's simpler and better macthes
        the Khronos test model.
        2. Removed js-test-post.js everywhere (some tests included it in particularly crazy ways).
        3. Removed successfullyParsed = true, as js-test.js doesn't need that.
        4. Updated DOCTYPE, while editing these tests anyway.
        5. Tests now have correct order of lines in the output (no longer saying TEST COMPLETE
        before PASS), so updated results.
        6. In js-test tests, we shouldn't use waitUntilDone/notifyDone explicitly, so
        updated these with jsTestIsAsync.
        7. Updated async tests that used initNonKhronosFramework(false) plus some way to
        become async to simply say initNonKhronosFramework(true).
        8. Removed isSuccessfullyParsed() calls that several tests were using as an ugly
        workaround for issues caused by misusing the harness. This is never expected to be
        called directly.

        * fast/canvas/webgl/angle-instanced-arrays-out-of-bounds.html:
        Removed an unneeded js-test-style.css include.

        * fast/canvas/webgl/framebuffer-bindings-unaffected-on-resize.html:
        Swapped lines to not have glErrorShouldBe after finishTest.

        * fast/canvas/webgl/resources/webgl-test.js:
        (initNonKhronosFramework): webgl-test.js relies on js-test anyway, so there is
        no need to duplicate the work.
        (nonKhronosFrameworkNotifyDone): Use the proper js-test mechanism.
        (finishTest): Ditto.
        (finishTest.epilogue.document.createElement.epilogue.onload): Deleted.

        * resources/js-test.js:
        (expectTrue): Added this function that we only has in js-test-pre.js.
        (): Perform work after test's load event handler, not immediately on DOMContentLoaded.
        This has two benefits:
        1. Tests that enable jsTestIsAsync in onload do work. This is expected, because
        tests that call waitUntilDone from onload also do work.
        2. Non-async tests that perform work in onload have the correct order of lines in output.

        shouldBecomeEqual() behaves as shouldBe() if the testing expression returns the expected value
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=133939

        Reviewed by Darin Adler.

        First call of eval(expression) inside shouldBecomeEqual was always
        made synchronously. If the testing expression returns the same value
        as expected one then shouldBecomeEqual() will immediately report PASS,
        for example,

        shouldBecomeEqual(internals.hasSpellingMarker("wellcome"), false);

        in consequence, assuming asynchronous path of spellchecking, spelling markers
        may appear after a while.

        The bug was caused by checking a condition at the beginning of shouldBecomeEqual(),
        before calling a timer. As a result, queued asynchronous events doesn't effect
        this checking.

        * TestExpectations:
        This fix reveals new bugs in execDeleteCommand() behaviour, two tests need

        * TestExpectations: Added entries fast/parser/document-write-fighting-eof.html and fast/parser/document-write-partial-entity-before-load.html
        and removed these entries from the GTK, Mac, and Windows-specific TestExpectation files. These tests are known to fail in debug builds on
        all ports. See http://webkit.org/b/110546 for more details.

        These scripts were not "slow" at all - 100 microseconds is nothing. Furthermore,
        slow-loading-sheet-in-error.php wasn't even used, because of a typo in the test.
        And worst of all, WebCore has its own ideas about when to load stylesheets - notably,
        default stylesheet loading blocks script execution, so we cannot do anything before
        the stylesheet loads.

        Continuously repainting large parts of Huffington Post.
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=139468

        Reviewed by Antti Koivisto.

        This patch eliminates redundant repaint requests for inlines when neither the parent
        block flow nor any of the inline children are dirty.
        Previously,
        1. simple line layout always recalculated inline content positions regardless of whether
        the content needed relayout at all; as a result, it always triggered full repaint.
        2. inline tree layout ignored the needslayout flag on the last line and treated it dirty
        (unless it broke cleanly (<div>foo<br></div>)).
        This was an ancient workaround for an editing/insert use case, but it seems not to be the case anymore.

        rdar://problem/19050653

        Reviewed by Antti Koivisto.

        In certain cases, when block flow needs to compute the preferred width of a particular text
        renderer, we use the non-simple line layout text measuring.
        However, the same text renderer might end up at simple line layout later.
        Complex line layout measures text including the trailing space and it subtracts
        (the constant value of) space width afterwards, while simple line layout measures
        runs without the extra space.
        In such cases, this may result different word widths and produce unexpected line breaking. (preferred width != final width)
        In long term, any text renderer qualified for simple line layout should go through the simple
        text measuring code path. (https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=138973)
        For now, just copy complex line layout behaviour. This also matches the previous simple line layout line breaking implementation.

        Add initial layout testing coverage for timer throttling
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=138809

        Reviewed by Simon Fraser.

        Add initial layout test coverage for timer throttling. It currently
        covers the following cases:
        - Repeating timer changes the style of an Element that is visible
        - Repeating timer changes the style of an Element that is not visible
          (i.e. "display: none").
        - Repeating timer doing DOM mutations
        - Nested timer changes the style of an Element that is visible
        - Nested timer changes the style of an Element that is not visible
          (i.e. "display: none").
        - Nested timer doing DOM mutations

        More layout tests are coming. In particular, we should add coverage for
        changing the style of an Element outside the viewport. We should also
        Test that the timer gets unthrottled if necessary on scrolling / layout.

        Lazily create HTMLInputElement's inputType and shadow subtree
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=138524

        Reviewed by Ryosuke Niwa.

        Add a test case to make sure we don't crash when parsing an <input>
        Element that has a |border| attribute as first attribute. This is what
        was happening with the first version of this patch that landed in
        r175852. When attributeChanged() was called for the |border| attribute
        HTMLInputElement::isPresentationAttribute() would get called before

        Give pseudo elements the correct specificity
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=138378

        Given that all selector affecting the pseudo element were offset by one,
        it is impossible to use a pseudo element directly to affect the order, making the bug
        hard to test.

        What I did here for testing is use the stauration at 255 of any specificity field.
        With 255 class + 1 pseudo element, the old code would saturate at (0, 255, 0), while
        the fixed code would correctly give (0, 255, 1). By comparing that to a non-saturated
        selector, I can show the fix is correct.

        Those tests come from blink. Rune solved the same problem a year ago on blink
        in https://chromiumcodereview.appspot.com/23710067
        The patch is quite different because blink uses an ancient code base, but the tests
        can still be useful so I included them here.

        Ensure the CSS un-prefixed column properties are behaving the same way as the
        prefixed ones. The CSS prefixed column properties are still supported by making
        them aliases of the un-prefixed ones.  Also port some of the W3C and Mozilla
        tests for css column properties tests.

        Remove invalid float from RootInlineBox.

        Reviewed by Antti Koivisto.

        In certain cases, floating boxes get attached to the last (root) inline box.
        When this particular floating box gets destroyed, it also needs to be detached
        from the last inline box.

        CSS4 Selectors: Add the pseudo class :any-link
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=138128

        Reviewed by Andreas Kling.

        Story time: I implement only half of the patch and run
        fast/selectors/webkit-any-link.html to make sure it fails...
        and the test happily PASS.

        I look into it and sure enough, a last minute change in
        html-link-type-tests.js made it test nothing but :link.

        I update html-link-type-tests.js to actually test the desired selector,
        run the test again: PASS.

        I debug a bit and I find why my code is not tested: html-link-type-tests.js
        uses Element.matches() and that does not use the CSS JIT.

        Fair enough, I add a querySelectorAll("#target' + selector + '") to run
        through the JIT: PASS.

        Since that selector is simple-#id + simple selector, we go through a fast
        path for ids and skip the JIT. Arrrrg!

        Finally, I added querySelectorAll(".target' + selector + '"), which covers
        the CSS JIT.

        The nice thing is: all those cases are tested now :)

        Update Yosemite results for platform/mac/editing/spelling/delete-autocorrected-word-2.html.

        Looks like this got confused during Yosemite tests landing.

        This test is currently marked as failing on WK2, but it passed for me, so maybe we
        can mark it as passing there too. Tracked as bug 105616.

        Prior to Yosemite results landing, this test was marked as failing on WK2, and its
        results matched WK1. It got changed several times during the merge, so it ended
        up being marked as failing on WK1, but with WK1 results landed.

        Let's land WK2 results and keep testing on WK2. Also, Mavericks results were no different
        from Yosemite.

        Clamp wordSpacing percentage value.
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=129350.

        Reviewed by Zalan Bujtas.

        Make sure that setting the CSS style wordSpacing property to very huge percentage
        value and blending this value with other values for animating key frames does
        not assert or crash. The expectation is to have this huge value to be clamped to
        the pre-defined min/max values for the CSS length type. So when blending the clamped
        value with other wordSpacing values, the result can't be NaN. This should be very
        similar to the case when it is set to a huge <length> value.

        SVG loaded through html <img> can't request to load any external resources.
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=137762.

        Also ensure the same rule is enforced on cached resources.

        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=137907

        Updated tests to reflect that the results of changing where a native call frame
        and therefore the lexicalGlobalObject came from.  Verified that these tests changes
        are consistent with the HTML standard.  These changes are also closer to the behavior
        of other browsers.

        Updated the test to really have a different domain.  We do a simple string comparison
        to check for that we are part of the same domain.  The test expected that 0.0.1 was
        from the same domain as 127.0.0.1.  Changed the test to try 0.0.2 and expect a

        Add test for innerHTML mutations that yield identical DOM.
        <https://webkit.org/b/137823>

        Reviewed by Chris Dumez.

        I made this test while working on an optimization, and it seems useful
        to have in the tree since it adds additional coverage. The optimization
        may come later.

        The test works by creating little DOM subtrees like so:

            <foo><bar>some text</bar></foo>

        It then overwrites that subtree with an identical one by mutating the
        containing element's innerHTML property. It then verifies that the DOM
        structure is correct and that Node wrappers retain any custom properties
        set on them.

        When the alignment is center, which is the common case for math, changing the size of
        an object affects the position of this object also.  We need to confirm that zooming or

        * platform/mac/mathml/opentype/opentype-stretchy-horizontal-expected.txt:
        This test was wrong because of the spacing issue. The page has two <mover> math objects at the beginning.
        Each of them has an <mspace> child. The width of the first <mspace> is 1em while the width of the second
        <mspace> is 2em. The font size is 10pt. So it is expected to have the first one 10 pixels and the second 
        to be 20 pixels. In the test, the width of the first is 22 and the width of the second is 32.
        I do expect this test to fail on other platforms since they have the same mistake which is now fixed. I am
        going to submit the mac expected version only and when it fails I am going to collect the result and submit
        another patch for the other platforms expected files.

        Reviewed by Andreas Kling.

        There are 3 big kind of changes to the tests:
        1) The new implementation intentionally breaks :not() of :visited and :link.
           Some test for the basic :not(:link) and :not(:visited) are consequently failing.
        2) Some tests were ensuring that :not() only support simple selectors, those are
           becoming irrelevant.
        3) New test for the feature.

        Inline ruby does not get justified correctly
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=137421

        Reviewed by Dave Hyatt.

        Test that ruby gets spaces inside the ruby base, and that hit testing the
        ruby base gives us correct answers.

        * platform/mac/fast/ruby/bopomofo-rl-expected.txt: Ruby text gets the CSS
        property text-align: justify, which worked prior to this patch. However, this
        patch now justifies ruby bases, so now if there is text that is both a ruby
        base and ruby text (such as ruby in ruby) it correctly gets justified. This
        test does such, and therefore needs to be rebaselined.
