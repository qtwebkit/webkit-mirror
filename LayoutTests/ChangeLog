            Reviewed by David Kilzer.

            A renderer should never be assigned to multiple selection subtrees. (Currently RenderObject maintains the last selection state.)
            RenderView::applySubtreeSelection() loops from the start to the end of the selection to find renderers that are inside the selection.
            However, in case of regions (when multiple selection roots are present) traversing the renderer tree by calling RenderObject::nextInPreOrder() could
            end up going across selection roots.
            This patch ensures that we assign renderers to a specific selection only when the current selection root and the renderer's selection root match.

            Tests introduced in r187489 are flaky, they sometimes print the console
            message, sometimes not. The reason is that we sometimes use a cached
            parsed stylesheet and we do not print the warning in this case. To fix
            the flakiness, we now clear the memory cache at the beginning of each
            test to make sure we download and parse the stylesheets.

            -In CSSOM, StyleSheet.insertRule() could create bogus rules.
             The new test verifies that the call fails instead of creating undefined
             behaviors.
            -In ContentExtensions, large selectors are now working correctly. The tests

            Since the thumb is positioned after the layout for the input (shadow) subtree is finished, the repaint rects
            issued during the layout will not cover the re-positioned thumb.
            We need to issue a repaint soon after the thumb is re-positioned.
